This unique opportunity was built upon students' desire to grow and learn from one another, all while creating impactful work for our community. Establishing a strong sense of community through our work allows us to actually have fun in the mean time.

                    <p>
                        Our five teams work in weekly design and development sprints, taking part in the entire design process. In the end, each team has created bespoke brands and products specific to meet their client's needs. The Studio experience involves being part of an integrative learning and teaching environment as well as applying skills learned from classes and co-ops. Studio teams have a high level of ownership over their projects as well as the chance to test out new creative pursuits.
